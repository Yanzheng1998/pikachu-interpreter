This is an interpreter for the Pikachu Programming Language. It was made because the original interpreter (and syntax rules) were unable to distinguish between subtraction and division.

The site where I found this language is: http://trove42.com/introducing-pikachu-programming-language/
The syntax rules for the language can be found in syntax.txt.

To run the interpreter, execute the following commands.

javac *.java
java Driver

Follow the instructions to enter the pikachu file and the inputs you want to use, or to run the tests.
